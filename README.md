## Steps Taken:
1) Created a Django project.
2) Integrated React.js and Tailwind.css through webpack.
3) Took care of basic routing by using React components and react-router-dom. Took care of dynamic routing through Django's backend.
4) Constructed the backend api with unit testings (include the tests in github action's yaml file).
5) Deployed on AWS EC2 after dockerization.
